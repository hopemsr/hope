<img src="c:\Users\Dhiren\Downloads\cpu logo.png" alt="centralian logo" style="float:right;width: 150px;height: 150px;"


    ></p> Speakers and students from Central Philippine University (CPU) introduced us to HTML, the foundation of 
    website development. DevCon representatives guided us through Hour of Code, an interactive platform for simplified
     and hands-on coding.</p>

     <h2>Agile Methodology Introduction and Workshop</h2>
     <p>Agile Methodology was presented as a flexible approach to building software in small, adaptable steps. The
        workshop introduced five key Agile roles, highlighting teamwork and efficiency in project development.</p>

    <h2>Agile Roles</h2>
    <p>Product Owner:
        Manages the product vision, prioritizes the backlog, and ensures the team delivers value to stakeholders.</p>

    <p>Scrum Master:
        Facilitates the Agile process, removes obstacles, and supports the team in following Scrum practices.
 </p>
    <p>Developer:
        Writes, tests, and maintains the code to build the product.
 </p>
    <p>UI/UX Designer:
        Designs user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces, focusing on user experience.
 </p>
    <p>Quality Assurance (QA) Specialist:
        Tests the product to ensure it meets requirements and is free of defects.</p>


    <h2>UI/UX Crash Course</h2>
    <p>A speaker from CPU taught us the fundamentals of UI/UX design, highlighting its focus on creating user-friendly and visually
       appealing interfaces. We learned the difference between UI (user interface) and UX (user experience), where UI
       focuses on aesthetics like colors, typography, and icons, while UX ensures usability and functionality. 
       Key principles emphasized were usability, aesthetics, and consistency, with lessons on using colors and contrast 
       for accessibility, choosing readable fonts and sizes, and maintaining balance with white space. They also 
       explained how grid systems help structure layouts and why consistency in icons and design elements improves user 
       experience.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>They taught us a lot throughout the experience, starting with HTML coding basics, where we learned how to structure websites
       and use HTML elements. DevCon representatives introduced us to Hour of Code, an interactive platform that made coding more 
       accessible and engaging. We also explored Agile methodology, learning how software development is done in small, flexible 
       steps, with teams working collaboratively in key roles like the Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer, UI/UX Designer, and 
       QA Specialist. The importance of these roles in ensuring smooth project execution was emphasized. Finally, we dove into 
       UI/UX design, focusing on usability, aesthetics, and consistency, with lessons on colors, typography, grid systems, and the 
       effective use of white space, all of which are essential for creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.</p>
